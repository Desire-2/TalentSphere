## üìã Overview

- **Blockquotes**: `>` for quoted text
- **Horizontal rules**: `---` for dividers
- **Tables**: GitHub Flavored Markdown tables
- **Strikethrough**: `~~text~~` for crossed-out text
- **Task lists**: `- [ ]` and `- [x]` for checklists

### 2. **Custom Styling**
Each markdown element has been styled to match TalentSphere's design system:
- Links: Blue color with hover effects
- Headings: Gray-900 with appropriate sizing
- Lists: Proper indentation and spacing
- Code: Gray background with syntax highlighting
- Blockquotes: Color-coded left border (blue for description, green for requirements, purple for process)
