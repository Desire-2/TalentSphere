## Development Notes

### Mock Data
Currently, the system uses mock data for:
- Admin statistics (will be replaced with actual tracking)
- Activity logs (will be replaced with audit logging)
- System health metrics (will be enhanced with real monitoring)

### Future Enhancements
- Real-time notifications for admin actions
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Role-based permission granularity
- Integration with external monitoring tools
- Automated backup scheduling
- Multi-factor authentication support

### Testing
- Test all admin functionality with different user roles
- Verify access controls and permission checks
- Test settings persistence and retrieval
- Validate email configuration with real SMTP servers
- Test backup and restore functionality

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet usage
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of admin components
- Optimized API calls with caching
- Efficient data fetching strategies
- Resource monitoring and optimization
