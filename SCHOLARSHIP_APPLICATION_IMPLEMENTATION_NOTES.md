## Technical Specifications

### Frontend Components

#### ScholarshipApplication.jsx (700+ lines)
**Purpose**: Main internal application form component

```javascript
{
  scholarship,        // Loaded from API
  loading,           // API loading state
  submitting,        // Form submission state
  uploadingFile,     // File upload state
  error,             // Error messages

## Data Model Integration

### ScholarshipApplication Table
Already exists, used fields:
- `id` - Primary key
- `scholarship_id` - FK to scholarship
- `user_id` - FK to user
- `status` - 'submitted', 'under_review', 'accepted', 'rejected'
- `application_data` - JSON string with form data
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `updated_at` - Timestamp

### Scholarship Table
Uses fields:
- `application_type` - Enum: 'internal', 'external', 'email'
- `application_url` - String (for external)
- `application_email` - String (for email)
- `application_deadline` - DateTime
- `application_count` - Integer (stats)
- `application_instructions` - Text (optional)
- `requires_*` - Booleans for document requirements
- `essay_topics` - Text (for internal essays)

---

## API Integration Points

### Frontend Services

**scholarshipService.applyToScholarship()**
```javascript
// Already exists, handles POST /scholarships/:id/apply
const response = await scholarshipService.applyToScholarship(id, data);
```

**scholarshipService.trackApplicationClick()**
```javascript
// Already exists, handles POST /scholarships/:id/track-application
const response = await scholarshipService.trackApplicationClick(id);
```

**scholarshipService.getScholarshipDetail()**
```javascript
// Already exists, retrieves full scholarship object
const scholarship = await scholarshipService.getScholarshipDetail(id);
```

---

## Routing Configuration

### Public Routes
- `GET /` → Home
- `GET /scholarships` → Scholarship list
- `GET /scholarships/:id` → Scholarship details

### Protected Routes (job_seeker role required)
- `GET /scholarships/:id/apply` → Application form page
- `POST /scholarships/:id/apply` → Submit application (API)
- `POST /scholarships/:id/track-application` → Track click (API)
- `GET /scholarships/:id/application-success` → Success page

---

## Security Implementation

### Authentication
- All endpoints protected with JWT token
- Token validated before processing
- Includes user_id from token for authorization

### Authorization
- Role-based: Only job_seeker and admin can apply
- User can only view their own applications
- Duplicate application prevention

### Input Validation
- Client-side: Real-time validation feedback
- Server-side: Strict validation on all inputs
- Email format validation (both sides)
- GPA range validation (0-4.0)
- Date validation (must be in future for deadline)

### Data Protection
- Passwords not logged
- Sensitive data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Rate limiting on form submission (consider adding)
- CSRF tokens in requests

---

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend
- Form validation: O(n) where n = number of fields
- File upload: Async, doesn't block UI
- Image lazy loading: Already implemented in components
- Pagination: Not needed for single scholarship

### Backend
- Database indexes on: scholarship_id, user_id, application_deadline
- Query optimization: Single query for scholarship details
- Application count: Increment, not recalculate
- N+1 query prevention: Eager load relations

### Caching
- Scholarship details: Cache for 5 minutes (recommended)
- User profile: Cache for session duration
- Application count: Update immediately

---

## Error Handling

### Frontend Error Scenarios
1. **Scholarship not found** → 404 page
2. **Deadline passed** → Application closed message
3. **Already applied** → Duplicate error message
4. **Network error** → Retry toast message
5. **Validation error** → Field-level error display
6. **File upload error** → Toast notification
7. **Unauthenticated** → Redirect to login

### Backend Error Scenarios
1. **Invalid scholarship ID** → 404
2. **Unauthorized user** → 401
3. **Wrong application type** → 400
4. **Duplicate application** → 400
5. **Deadline passed** → 400
6. **Database error** → 500 with rollback
