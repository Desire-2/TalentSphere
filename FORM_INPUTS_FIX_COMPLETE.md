# Form Inputs Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue Identified

The CreateScholarship form had several `FormField` components that were missing required props (`errors`, `formData`, `onInputChange`), which prevented the input fields from rendering. Users saw labels and tooltips but no text boxes or input areas to enter data.

## Root Cause

The `FormField` component has this logic:

```jsx
{children || (
  onInputChange && (
    <StableInput ... />
  )
)}
```

Without `onInputChange` prop, the condition evaluates to false and no input renders. Only fields with `children` (like `Select` dropdowns) would display.

## Fields Fixed

### Organization Information Section ✅
- `external_organization_name` - Added props
- `external_organization_website` - Added props
- `external_organization_logo` - Added props
- `source_url` - Added props

### Academic Information Section ✅
- `field_of_study` - Added props

### Location & Eligibility Section ✅
- `country` - Added props
- `state` - Added props
- `city` - Added props
- `nationality_requirements` - Added props

### Financial Information Section ✅
- `amount_min` - Added props
- `amount_max` - Added props

### Application Process Section ✅
- `application_deadline` - Added props
- `application_url` - Added props
- `application_email` - Added props

## Changes Made

Added three required props to each affected `FormField` component:

```jsx
<FormField
  label="Organization Name"
  field="external_organization_name"
  placeholder="e.g., ABC Foundation"
  required
  tooltip="Name of the organization offering this scholarship"
  errors={errors}          // ← Added
  formData={formData}      // ← Added
  onInputChange={handleInputChange}  // ← Added
/>
```

## Fields Already Working

These fields already had the props or use `children` (Select components):
- ✅ `title` - Already had props
- ✅ `summary` - Already had props
