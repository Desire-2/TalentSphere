# Edit External Job - Cursor Focus Fix Complete ✅

## Issue Description
Users experienced cursor focus loss when typing in form fields in `EditExternalJob.jsx`. After typing one character, the cursor would disappear and require clicking back into the field to continue typing.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Unconditional Field Component Recreation**
The `Field` wrapper component was being recreated on every render, causing React to treat it as a new component instance.

### 2. **Hook Order Violation**
The `useCallback` hook for `Field` was initially placed after the `if (loading)` conditional return, violating the Rules of Hooks.

### 3. **Inefficient FormField Memoization**
The `FormField` component was re-rendering on every parent state change, even when unrelated fields were updated.

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fix 1: Remove Inline Field Wrapper
**File:** `EditExternalJob.jsx` (Line ~780 onwards)

```jsx
<FormField
  {...sharedFieldProps}
  label="Job Title"
  field="title"
  placeholder="e.g., Senior Frontend Developer"
  required
  tooltip="A clear, descriptive title that accurately reflects the role"
  icon={Target}
/>
```

**Why:** Rendering a wrapper component (`Field`) inside the render body caused React to treat each usage as a new component, unmounting the underlying inputs and stealing focus. Passing the shared props directly to `FormField` keeps component identity stable.

### ✅ Fix 2: Shared Field Props Memo
**File:** `EditExternalJob.jsx` (Line ~690)

```jsx
const sharedFieldProps = useMemo(() => ({
  formData,
  errors,
  onInputChange: handleInputChange
}), [formData, errors, handleInputChange]);
```

**Why:** Consolidating the frequently reused props into a memoized object keeps the JSX tidy while ensuring `FormField` receives the latest data without recreating wrapper components.

### ✅ Fix 3: Enhanced FormField Memoization
**File:** `EditExternalJob.jsx` (Line ~90-140)

```jsx
const FormField = React.memo(({ 
  label, field, type, /* ... other props ... */
}) => {
  // Memoize the select change handler
  const handleSelectChange = useCallback((value) => {
    onInputChange(field, value);
  }, [field, onInputChange]);
  
  // Component JSX...
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Custom comparison - only re-render if THIS field's data changed
  return (
    prevProps.formData[prevProps.field] === nextProps.formData[nextProps.field] &&
    prevProps.errors[prevProps.field] === nextProps.errors[nextProps.field] &&
    prevProps.field === nextProps.field &&
    prevProps.type === nextProps.type &&
    prevProps.label === nextProps.label &&
    prevProps.placeholder === nextProps.placeholder &&
    prevProps.required === nextProps.required
  );
});
```

**Why:** This prevents unnecessary re-renders. When typing in one field, other fields won't re-render.

### ✅ Fix 4: Removed Unnecessary Key Prop
**File:** `EditExternalJob.jsx`

**Before:**
```jsx
<StableInput
  key={field} // ❌ Causes remounting
  field={field}
  // ...
/>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<StableInput
  field={field}
  // No key prop needed
  // ...
/>
```

**Why:** The `key` prop was causing React to unmount and remount the input, losing focus.

## Technical Explanation

### Why Cursor Was Lost
1. **State Update Flow:**
  - User types a character → `stableInputChange` called
  - `setFormData` updates state → component re-renders
  - Inline `Field` wrapper redefined; React remounts the underlying input
  - Input element loses focus immediately after each keystroke

### How Fix Resolves It
1. **Stable Component Identity:**
  - Direct `FormField` usage keeps component identity intact across renders
  - React preserves the DOM node for the active input
   - Input maintains focus

2. **Minimal Re-renders:**
   - Custom comparison function in `React.memo`
   - Only re-render when specific field data changes
   - Typing in one field doesn't affect others

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Type continuously in any text input field
- [x] Type in textarea fields (Description, Skills, etc.)
- [x] Type in number fields (Salary, Experience years)
- [x] Switch between different fields while typing
- [x] No React Hook errors in console
- [x] No "Rendered more hooks" warnings
- [x] Cursor stays in place throughout typing

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix:
- **Every keystroke:** All form fields re-render
- **Focus loss:** Yes
- **Hook errors:** Yes
- **User experience:** Poor

### After Fix:
- **Every keystroke:** Only the active field re-renders
- **Focus loss:** No
- **Hook errors:** No
- **User experience:** Smooth and responsive

## Files Modified
1. `/talentsphere-frontend/src/pages/external-admin/EditExternalJob.jsx`
   - Line ~90-140: Enhanced `FormField` memoization with custom comparison
   - Line ~621: Moved `Field` hook before conditional returns
   - Line ~695: Removed duplicate Field declaration

## Verification

Run the frontend and test:
```bash
cd talentsphere-frontend
npm run dev
```

Navigate to: Edit External Job page and test typing in any field.

## Additional Notes

- This fix follows React best practices for form optimization
- The same pattern can be applied to other forms with similar issues
- The `StableInput` component already had good optimization
- The issue was in the wrapper components, not the base input
