## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: JSON Parse Error
**Cause:** Invalid JSON syntax  
**Solution:**
1. Copy JSON to jsonlint.com
2. Find and fix syntax errors
3. Common issues: missing commas, unmatched brackets, unescaped quotes

### Problem: Import Fails
**Cause:** Missing required fields  
**Solution:**
1. Verify title, organization_name, description, deadline are present
2. Check scholarship_type and category_id
3. Ensure application_type and corresponding URL/email

### Problem: Dates Don't Work
**Cause:** Wrong date format  
**Solution:**
- Use YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2026-06-30)
- Not MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY
- Dates must be in the future

### Problem: Amounts Not Importing
**Cause:** Wrong format for numbers  
**Solution:**
- Use "50000" not "$50,000" or "50,000"
- Numbers as strings in JSON: "amount_max": "50000"

### Problem: AI Generated Incomplete Data
**Cause:** Prompt not specific enough  
**Solution:**
1. Add more detail to SCHOLARSHIP CONTEXT
2. Explicitly state "fill ALL fields"
3. Provide examples of desired output
4. Try a different AI tool
